# To-Do-App
Using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript I am going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that helps users keep track of various tasks.
Please find information below to navigate the app with relevant screenshots.

Welcome to my To-Do App.

Step 1:

A user can enter a new task and due date in the below input fields and thereafter click on the 'Add Task' button where the task will be added to the task list.

You can add as many tasks as you would like by doing Step 1 again as the input fields are cleared after each task has been added.


Step 2:

The following buttons are: 
1) Edit Task - You can edit your task
2) Delete Task  - You can delete your task
3) Completed Task  - You can complete your task

If you wish to Edit your task, you can click on the button mentioned above to be number 1.

A line will be drawn through your task and its due date, so that it is clearly visible that you completed the task.
